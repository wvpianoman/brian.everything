# brian-everything

 This is my personal installation/maintenance scripts for  **Ultramarine**/**Nobara** (*Fedora*), **Garuda** and **PikaOS** here, but I only have it as a backup/failsafe/woops (because sometimes I tinker until I break my OS, and I HAVE to get back up and going *A.S.A.P*).  You will find mothballed stuff for *Solus*, *MXLinux*, *siduction*, *BigLinux* and *NixOS*.
 
 I do have this repo curated to fit my personal use-case, but you may find some help/ideas here to help you on your Linux journey.

 I have taken inspiration from my brother from another mother, Tolga Erok.  If it were not for him, I would not be nearly as far in my Linux journey!!  Thanks, bro!

 You can find his GitHub here   https://github.com/tolgaerok

 He has collections available for NixOS, Debian, Fedora, Bluefin / Aurora and Solus.
