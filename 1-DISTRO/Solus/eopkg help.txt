rebuild-db (rdb)

Rebuild all `eopkg` databases. This may be required if eopkg
is interrupted or killed during an operation, and complains
that database recovery is required (DB5 errors). Running this
command will reassemble the database from all the installed
packages.



remove-orphans (rmo)

Remove any packages that were automatically installed and
no longer have any dependency relationship with non
automatically installed packages on the system.

Note that in Solus terminology an orphan is a proveable
concept, not an automatic heuristic. Thus, the only
candidates in the algorithm are those packages that
were marked automatic as dependencies of another operation,
and are no longer required by other packages on the system
that aren't automatically installed.


update-repo (ur) <reponame?>

With no arguments this command will update all repository
indexes by fetching them from their origin if a change
has occurred. This will then synchronise the remote
data with the local data so that changes to the repository
are now visible to eopkg.

You may optionally specify a repository name to only
update that repository.

    -f, --force:

    Forcibly update the repository indexes, even if the checksum file for the index hasn't been changed. Typically the checksum file is first consulted before downloading the larger index itself.




clean

Forcibly delete any stale file locks held by previous instances
of eopkg. This should only be used if the package manager refuses
to operate due to a stale lockfile, perhaps caused by a previous
power failure.




delete-cache (dc)

Clear out any temporary caches still held by `eopkg` for downloads
and package files. These are automatically cleared when using the
Software Centre but you must manually invoke `dc` if you only use
the CLI approach to software management.
